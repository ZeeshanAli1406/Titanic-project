Project Description: Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset to analyze the socio-demographic factors influencing passenger survival rates.
By examining variables such as age, gender, class, and family size, I aimed to uncover patterns and insights that reveal the underlying factors contributing to survival outcomes. 
The project utilized various data visualization techniques, including correlation heatmaps, to present findings clearly and effectively.
Through this analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of the historical event's human aspect and the significant role demographics played in the tragedy.
